If you're working with React components, you've probably encountered the need to manage the state within your components. React provides the `useState` hook for managing simple states, but sometimes, the number of states that need to be managed can make the code confusing and disorganized.

In this post, we'll present a way to avoid excessive `useState` usage in a React component by grouping related states into an object and managing them with a single `useState`.

The first step is to create an initial object that contains all the related states. For example, if you have *states* for "name" and "age," you can create an initial object like this:

```jsx
const initialState = {
  name: '',
  age: ''
}
```

Next, use `useState` to manage the entire object. For example:

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

When you need to update a specific state, use `setState` to update the entire object. For example:

```jsx
const handleNameChange = (event) => {
  setState({
    ...state,
    name: event.target.value
  });
}
```

To access individual states, you can destructure them from the entire object. For example:

```javascript
const { name, age } = state;
```

Conclusion

This way, you can avoid excessive `useState` usage and keep your code more organized and manageable. By grouping related states into an object and managing them with a single useState, you can maintain clear and simple code without sacrificing flexibility and scalability.
