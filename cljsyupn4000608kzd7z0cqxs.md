Every developer needs to practice, right? A developer's life isn't just about books or Stack Overflow, so I've gathered some APIs that I've used to learn while having fun on front-end projects and also add to your portfolio 😍

If you need inspiration for the project, I use the [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) to search for design references but don't worry too much about searching, I'll leave some templates for each API!

✋🏻 **Don't forget to credit the designer, ok.**

# **PokeAPI**

Have you ever thought about creating a Pokedex? knowing all existing Pokemon? Then it's time to explore this magnificent API that provides all the necessary information to create a huge pokedex and make Ash jealous.

API 👉🏻 [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)

Let's go to the references to test your skills, Pokedex is cool to do for mobile, to have the same experience as our colleague Ash.

# **MovieDB**

This one is classic! Who doesn't want to build a Netflix? But only with information, this API is COMPLETE, with tons of information about movies and series, with this API you will be able to search for movies in theaters, check the cast, ratings and WOW, it gives you a small authentication and user session control! I'm sure this is one of the best APIs to practice.

The reference I don't even need to say, is **Netflix**! but with the special touch of no movie, only information 🫠

Two amazing references to practice your dev skills:

# **Marvel**

Ultron released the code of the multiverse and now we can navigate through all the characters of this enormous API. For the nerds out there, I'm sure it will be an adventure to develop a guide with all the Marvel characters.

The Marvel API is commented on in each return field, making it even easier to understand.

Outsmart Tony Stark and build a powerful application with this reference 👊🏻

That's it, folks, with these 3 examples you will already acquire a lot of knowledge on how to work with an API and for sure it will help you in future projects!

But don't limit yourself to just these APIs listed above, there are several public APIs for you to access and create your applications and tune up your portfolio.

Hope I helped! See you next time 👋🏻
